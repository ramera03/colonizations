    The United States of America was the first colony to decolonize*. In 1789, the Constitution was ratified, the first document of its kind. As colonies gained independence thereafter, more and more constitutions legitimized the governing powers of new nations. The ratification of such documents allowed for formerly colonized peoples to exercise <b>self determination</b>, or the right to decide one's own political destiny. Constitutions have thus become a requirement for legitimate statehood.<br<br>
